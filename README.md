# HexalBytes: EarthWise

## Project Overview
**HexalBytes** is an environmental sustainability initiative aiming to encourage eco-friendly behaviors through the mobile application **EarthWise**. The app enables users to track their carbon footprint, learn about environmental issues, share knowledge, and earn rewards for sustainable actions. It integrates features from three initial solutions—GreenMind, EcoPanel, and EarthNet—into one comprehensive platform.

## Features
- **Tracking**: Users can record their environmentally-friendly actions and track their carbon footprint using a built-in calculator.
- **Learning**: Access the latest environmental news, online courses, and live streams to stay informed and adopt sustainable habits.
- **Sharing**: Users can share their eco-friendly journeys and insights with others in a community-driven platform.
- **Earning**: Earn reward points for eco-friendly behaviors, which can be redeemed for merchandise, services, and even tree-planting initiatives.

## Key Components
### 1. **User Experience Enhancements**
- **Improved Interface**: Added clearer measurement units for tracking actions, refined "Add" button visibility, and streamlined reward redemption with a search and filter function.
- **Guided Usage**: More intuitive interfaces for tracking carbon footprints and adding actions, supported by on-screen tips.

### 2. **Research-Informed Design**
- **Think-aloud Studies**: Usability testing revealed challenges in navigation and the reward system, which informed key updates.
- **Heuristic Evaluations**: Expert feedback led to further refinements, such as making critical buttons and features more visible.

### 3. **Target Users**
- **Primary Stakeholders**: Individuals who are aware of environmental issues but unsure how to take action.
- **Secondary Stakeholders**: Users actively engaged in eco-friendly behaviors.
- **Tertiary Stakeholders**: Environmental professionals and companies focused on sustainability.

## Roadmap
1. Further usability studies with primary and secondary stakeholders.
2. Refine the reward system with more incentives for eco-friendly actions.
3. Collaborate with businesses to expand reward options and partnerships.
4. Personalize the user experience with AI-driven environmental guidance.
